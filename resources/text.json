  "text":"VeChain will be bigger than NEO within 3-9months. 'I am proud to announce that as of today, Breyer Capital has agreed to support VeChain through an official advisory role,' - Jim Breyer, founder of Breyer Capital. Let's give a round of applause üëè for the people dumping $VEN... I cannot wait to buy up all your bags. VeChain releases a partnership every week. The coin of the week is Vechain (VEN). Unlike NEO, Vechain is officially working with the Chinese government. HUGE GAINS!!!!! What I just heard was abundantly impressive! I look at the partnerships and the extreme possibilities. Vechain is a monster that has been injected with an intergalactic steroid! Key words, signals, GLOBAL!!! This is just the beginning!!! Q2 June Blessed to own Vechain!!!"
