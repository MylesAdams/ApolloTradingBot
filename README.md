Apollo, the Cryptocurrency trading bot.
Cryptocurrency trading bot that will buy and trade on exchanges, and make its decisions based on data analysis from social media, graphs, and historyical data.

## To Do For Reddit_Data
* Detail list of subreddits to gather data from
* Get familiar with reddit api
* Pull subscriber count and active users
* Figure out how data will be stored
* Determine algorithm for comparing growth rate across subreddits

## Accomplished
* CMake stopped working unannounced, will not make the main.cpp and claims it is not in the make options. Removed git repository recursively and initialized an entirely empty git and then cloned the master and cannot build or push anything. AHHHH
